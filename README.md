## Features

- **Dataset Navigation**: Load and navigate through entire datasets of survival curve images
- **Axis Calibration**: Point-and-click calibration with zoom window for precision
- **Auto-Population**: Automatic creation of survival percentage guidelines (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- **Status Tracking**: Mark images as Done/Error with visual indicators (‚úì/‚úó/‚óã)
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress bar and completion statistics
- **Smart Filtering**: "Show only incomplete" option to focus on unfinished work
- **Auto-Save**: All changes saved automatically - no data loss
- **Enhanced Zoom**: Zoom window with survival percentage guidelines for precise clicking
- **Group Management**: Dynamic management of experimental groups from metadata
- **Cross-Platform**: Standalone executables for Windows and macOS

## üöÄ Download Ready-to-Use Application

### For Non-Technical Users
Download the pre-built application from the [Releases](https://github.com/NikitiusIv/survival_curves_extractor/releases) page:
- **Windows**: `SurvivalCurveExtractor-Windows-x64.zip`
- **macOS**: `SurvivalCurveExtractor-macOS-arm64.zip` (M1/M2) or `-x64.zip` (Intel)

See the [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md) for installation instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (For Developers)

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry (recommended) or pip

### Using Poetry

```bash
poetry install
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**: Click "Select Dataset" and choose your `extraction_data` folder
2. **Calibrate Axes**: 
   - Enter axis min/max values (e.g., X: 0-30, Y: 0-100)
   - Click "Start Calibration"
   - Click 4 points on the image following the prompts
3. **Extract Points**:
   - Survival lines appear automatically after calibration
   - Click where curves intersect the percentage lines
   - Points are auto-saved as you work
4. **Complete Image**: 
   - Click "Done" when finished
   - Use navigation arrows to move to next image
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor completion with progress bar and status indicators

### Key Features

- **Table-Based Selection**: All possible points are pre-populated; simply select and click
- **Inline Editing**: Double-click any time value to edit it directly
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Delete key to remove selected points
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Removing groups automatically cleans up associated data points
- **Visual Feedback**: Markers update in real-time as points are edited or moved
