## üìä Using the Application

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Before starting, organize your files:

```
üìÅ Your_Project_Folder/
   üìÅ extraction_data/
      üìÅ png/
         üìÑ image1.png
         üìÑ image2.png
         üìÑ ...
      üìÅ metatdata/
         üìÑ image1.json
         üìÑ image2.json
         üìÑ ...
      üìÅ results/
         (This will be created automatically)
```

### Step 2: Start the Application

1. **Launch the app** by double-clicking it
2. A window will open showing "Select a dataset to begin image annotation"

### Step 3: Load Your Dataset

1. Click **"Select Dataset"** button at the top
2. Navigate to and select your `extraction_data` folder
3. The first image will load automatically

### Step 4: Calibrate the Axes

This tells the software what values correspond to the axes in your image.

1. **Look for "1. Axis Calibration"** on the left side
2. Enter the axis values:
   - X-min: The leftmost value on the X-axis (e.g., 0)
   - X-max: The rightmost value on the X-axis (e.g., 30)
   - Y-min: The bottom value on the Y-axis (e.g., 0)
   - Y-max: The top value on the Y-axis (e.g., 100)

3. Click **"Start Calibration"**
4. Click on these points in order:
   - Click on the leftmost X-axis point
   - Click on the rightmost X-axis point
   - Click on the lowest Y-axis point
   - Click on the highest Y-axis point

üí° **Tip**: Enable "Show Zoom Window" for precise clicking!

### Step 5: Extract Data Points

After calibration:

1. The software automatically creates horizontal guidelines at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%
2. For each survival curve in your image:
   - Click where the curve intersects each percentage line
   - The software automatically records the time value

3. The data table on the right shows your progress

### Step 6: Save Your Progress

Your work is **automatically saved** as you go! You'll see status updates like:
- "Image marked as DONE ‚úì" when you click Done
- "Status cleared" when you click Undone

### Step 7: Navigate Between Images

Use the navigation bar at the top:
- **‚óÄ Previous** / **Next ‚ñ∂** buttons to move between images
- Progress bar shows completion percentage
- Status indicators:
  - ‚úì = Done
  - ‚úó = Has errors
  - ‚óã = Not completed

**Filter Option**: Check "Show only incomplete" to skip finished images

### Step 8: Mark Images Complete

When you finish extracting data from an image:
1. Click the **"Done"** button
2. The image is marked with ‚úì
3. Move to the next image

If you made a mistake:
- Click **"Undone"** to clear the status
- Click **"Report Error"** if there's a problem with the image
